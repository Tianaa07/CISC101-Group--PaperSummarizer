Purpose: Ensure compliance and safety.

Rules:

No hallucinations: summarize only from text.

Numeric fidelity: preserve reported values.

Missing-section logic: output “Section not provided.”

Chunking: split long text before summarization.

Workflow: Validate → Correct → Pass to rendering.

Strengthen evidence and hallucination guiderails

> 1. **Strict Evidence Mode**: Introduce a **mode or flag** (e.g., `evidence_mode = "strict"`). When it is set to `"strict"`:
>    
>    * The summarizer should:
>      
>      * Only include claims, equations, and results that appear in the provided text.
>      
>      * If it cannot find enough information, it must say so explicitly (e.g., “The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.”).
> 
> 2. **Section Warning Messages**
>    For sections that are:
>    
>    * missing / empty, or
>    
>    * too short (< 50 words)
>    
>    The module must instruct the system to output a **standardized warning**, such as:
> * “Section skipped: no usable text was provided.”
> 
> * “Section very short: summary may be incomplete.”
>   You decide the exact wording.
